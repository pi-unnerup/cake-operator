## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Prerequisites

Prerecuisites for running this lab are: 

1. A default cluster that you can deploy resources to. `kubectl cluster-info` should show you your current context
2. Docker installed. `docker version` should return the version
3. Make installed. `make --version` should return the version
4. golang v1.24. `go version` should return the version
5. A Docker registry that you can push images to. You can create a free registry on [dockerhub](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-hub/)

### Setup

The operator functionality runs as a container inside the cluster.

Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build IMG=<some-registry>/cake-operator:tag
```

```sh
make docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/cake-operator:tag
```

Create your manifests
```sh
make manifests
```

`ls -la config/crd/bases/` will show you the timestamp of the newly created manifest

### Deploy the operator and Custom Resource Definitiion

Deploy the operator to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/cake-operator:tag
make install
```
Notice that lots of Kubernetes Resources have been created as part of the operator. 

You should be able to confirm the CRD is installed by 

```sh
kubectl api-resources -n cake-operator-system
```

where your 'Cakes' resource type now shows up.

### Bake the cake

Now it's time to create your cake object using your operator and CRD created in the previous steps:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/tutorials_v1_cake.yaml
```

Your cake is now up and running! `kubectl describe cake cake-sample` confirms some details about your cake such as that it is running on nodeport 30300. Please note if you're running in a local cluster the 'node' may not be your local machine and so in order to view your cake in the browser please forward it to your localhost. [Here](https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/ui/port-forwarding/) is a neat guide on how to do it on Rancher Desktop in 10 seconds. 

Go to your browser and view your cake; localhost:30300 (or whichever port you assigned on your node)

### Customise the cake

Change your cake object `config/samples/tutorials_v1_cake.yaml` by adding some custom configuration, such as a colour and a decoration, then delete and apply the object again. 

```sh
kubectl delete -f config/samples/tutorials_v1_cake.yaml
kubectl apply -f config/samples/tutorials_v1_cake.yaml
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 


### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, don't forget to generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
