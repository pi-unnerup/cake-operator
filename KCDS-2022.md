# KCDS Muffin Time
Welcome to Muffin Time!

In this workshop we will modify, deploy and update the Kubernetes components going into making a cake:

- Operator
- Custom Resource Definition
- Custom Resource

## 1. Setup
## If you are using the Workshop Provided cluster

You will have been given access to a cluster, which comes with the operator pre-installed - before we start, make sure that your CLI is pointing to the right cluster:

```sh
kubectl config current-context
```

The name of your current context should be "kubernetes-admin@kubernetes". If the context reads anything else, you should ensure that your kubernetes config file is set to the one provided by your trainer 

```sh
export KUBECONFIG=<path/to/file>
```

## If you are using your own cluster

If you are using your own cluster or a local cluster on your own machine such as Rancher or Docker Desktop, you will need to first install the operator:

```sh
make deploy IMG=unnerup/cake-operator:latest
```

Later, if you want to uninstall the operator you can run:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## 2. Exploring the cluster

kubectl api-resources

make controller-gen
docker build -t unnerup/cake-operator:latest .
docker push unnerup/cake-operator:latest
make deploy IMG=unnerup/cake-operator:latest

To add a thing you will need to work with 
cake_controller.go
cake_types.go
